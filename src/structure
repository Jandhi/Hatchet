HATCHET STRUCTURE
-----------------

Every line is an expression

An expression can be:
- An identifier
- A function
- A function call
- A literal
    - int
    - uint
    - float
    - string
- A code block
- Variable assignment
- A constraint
- A struct


SCOPE
All code exists in a scope
All variables are owned, and deleted when their owner goes out of scope
They can be deleted too

EXPRESSIONS
Do they have order? Might ignore bedmas, go left to right religiously except for bracketing
